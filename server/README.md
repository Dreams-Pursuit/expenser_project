# The Expenser Project Server
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Jyrko/expenser_project)

Our Server is a cloud-enabled, fast, and offline-storage compatible.

## Prerequisites 

- **Boost** library have to be installed (version 1.6.0+) with path /usr/local/Cellar/boost or be added in a local directory in /libs/boost
- Create a **separate** build folder before using **cmake**


As a famous author of backend [Andrey Marshyn] writes on the [Expenser Website][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Expenser's
> server is to make it as fast
> as possible. 


## Tech
Our tech stack is incredible:

- [C++] - The world's leading language.
- [CROW] - The best C++ library for building a robust backend we ever knew.
- [PostgreSQL] - verified by time.
- [sqlpp11]
- [Boost]
- [cmake] 

And of course Expenser itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
